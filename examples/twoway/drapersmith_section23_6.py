# `rates` is an array with shape (4, 3, 2).  It holds the production rate
# data from Table 23.4 of Draper & Smith (3rd ed).
#
# Each "row" (i.e. each value of the first index) corresponds to a different
# reagent (labeled A, B, C and D in the text), and each "column" (i.e. each
# value of the second index) corresponds to a different catalyst (labeled 1,
# 2 and 3 in the text),
#
# For each reagent and catalyst, there are two production rates. So, for
# example, rates[2, 1] is [15, 9].  These two values are the production
# rates for the two tests conducted with reagent C and catalyst 2.
